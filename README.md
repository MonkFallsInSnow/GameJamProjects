# GameJamProjects
A few hastly put together games made with GameMaker Studio for local game jams (disclaimer: these are first attempts at a new hobby). These games are far (very far) from perfect, but if you happen to download and work on them I would appreciate seeing the fruits of your labor (monkfallsinsnow@gmail.com). Be well.
